    <strong>Coding</strong> is the act of translating from <em>human language into machine one. </em><br>
        It’s like writing in the computer’s language. Programming is a broader process in which coding plays a role as well..<br>

            <blockquote>"In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. 
            You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do with them."

            Aimee Morgan, a former Stanford University Libraries archivist, enrolled in an online course to learn Python programming language at the <dfn>age of 35</dfn>.<br>
            <cite> "Don’t listen to anyone who says you’ll never be worth anything unless you started programming in junior high. 
                The tech field is big, and there’s room for a lot of people. When I was younger, it was tough admitting to things I didn’t know. 
                Now that I’m older, it’s easier to deal with that initial frustration" </cite>, said Aimee for a interviw she had with The NewYork Times.

            C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore.<br>
            <del>it's a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.</del><br>
             <ins>So actually this kinda is about the whole “C is an inscrutable implementation-defined mess” thing. </ins> </p>
